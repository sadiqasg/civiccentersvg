Hey, Steve
So I couldn't work with the template - had to extract them to private files as seen.

Note:
The only active GIS application is on the index page. And as i told you, it is still a long way from being fully functional, but can serve well for any presentational purposes

I hope you can work with these extracts 

Things to note:
When integrating, please be aware of CSS and js constraints. And also note that page styles will be applied on GIS application. Incase something doesn't work, know you need to mark it as important. (major reasons I didn't want to work with the template)

The Conclusion:
I wish you well in your outing:- Go win us some money :)
